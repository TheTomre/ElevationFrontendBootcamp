<!-- JavaScript – closures
The following exercise contains the following subjects:
● closures
Instructions
Without running the code below, explain in your own
words what the result of each block of code will be and
why.

Block 1

var b = 1;
function someFunction(number) {
function otherFunction(input) {
return b;
}
b = 5;
return otherFunction;
}
var firstResult = someFunction(9);
var result = firstResult(2); -->

We don't have anything in console.log or alert so I will just tell what will be in this variables. Keeping in mind that parametres of both functions are not used at all we will have in variable firstReault a reference to function otherFunction (because we don't call but only reteurn function), and in var result we will have 5 because after calling someFunction it was reassigned to 5.



<!-- Block 2

var a = 1;
function b2() {
a = 10;
return;
function a() { }
}
b2();
console.log(a); -->

The output will be 1 because when calling b2() we firstly declaring a function a(due to hoisting) and then trying to assign a to 10. So the value of the global variable a is not changing.



<!-- Block 3

let i;
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
const log = () => {
console.log(i);
}
setTimeout(log, 100);
} -->

All three setTimeout callbacks refer to the same i variable, which has a value of 3 by the time they are executed, so it will be 3 three times
