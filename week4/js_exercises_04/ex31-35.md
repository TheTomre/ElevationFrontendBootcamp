We did not learn any debugging tools during lessons so I ws using VC code node.js debugger in this exircises. I nall of them during step by step process I could find a line where a problem was. I didn't write all bcause it is very easy. In last exercise i added counter to WHATCH do I cuold see that it don't change during the loop so the mistake was there.
